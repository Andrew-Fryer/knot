  <title>Knot DNS Resource Requirements</title>
  <section>
    <title>Hardware Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Knot DNS requirements are not very demanding for typical
      installations, and a comodity server or virtualized solution
      will be sufficient in most cases.
    </para>
    <para>
      However please not that there are some scenarios that will
      require the administrator attention and a testing of exact
      requirements before deploying Knot DNS in a production.  These
      cases include deployment for a large number of zones (DNS
      hosting), a large number of records in one or more zones (TLD)
      or large number of requests.

    <title>CPU Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Knot DNS is not very CPU requiring, but it can consume some CPU

    <title>Memory Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Knot DNS implementation focuses on the performance and thus can
      be very demanding for the memory.  The rough estimate for memory
      requirements is 5-7 times of the size of the zone in text
      format.  Again this is only a estimate and you are advised to do
      your own measurements before deploying Knot DNS into the
      production.

    <title>Supported Operating System</title>
    <para>
      Knot DNS itself is written in a portable way, but it depends on
      userspace-rcu library, which is the main constraint when it
      comes to the operating system support.  As far as we know the
      Knot DNS and userspace-rcu library can be compiled and run on
      Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and Mac OS X.
